# Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project 6: Feed Reader Testing

##Loading and Examining the project

- You can view and analyze a live version of the project thru GitHub Pages:
http://rxbx.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/

- You can examine the original files at the following link:
https://github.com/RxBx/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader

You can launch the app locally from the directory by opening the file "index.html" in a web browser.

##Additional Tests

I have added an additional suite of tests called "Remove Feed" that tests the implementation of a clickable span of "Remove" text on each "Feed Menu" item. This feature would remove a feed from the list when clicked.  Tests in this suite would verify the presence of a required "remove" class in the list items, presence and effectiveness of "removeFeed" and "refreshFeed" functions, and test the full implementation of the finishd feature with a Jquery-triggered "click" event on the "Remove" text in one of the Feed List list items.
